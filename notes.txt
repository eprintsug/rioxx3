For RIOXX3....

For on the way out (exporting) we just need an export plugin, we don't need to worry about virtual fields or override fields

Changes...

<rioxxterms:grant> uses funders or funders_avanced where available

<rioxxterms:project> now uses IDs not names... EPrints by and large never contains Project IDs :( but this is not a mandatory field - this will require a new field.... Projects Advanced plugin, or just an update to core? Or a new field in RIOXX?

<rioxxterms:creator> uses creators/editors/contributors and uses ORCIDs where available (like RIOXX2)

<rioxxterms:record_public_release_date> - datestamp field (i.e. when it went into live archive)

<rioxxterms:ext_relation> - related urls, id_number (if it looks like a DOI), official_url


Removal of...

<ali:free_to_read>
<rioxxterms:apc>
<rioxxterms:version_of_record>



Later....

For importing RIOXX3 we want to explore the idea of a RIOXX dataobj that acts as a buffer between the import and the eprint dataobj.
